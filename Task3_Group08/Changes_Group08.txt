Our app layout is implemented exactly as designed. Due to time constraints, we have not implemented all proposed features.
In particular, the app is missing the following proposed features:
- changing the location.
- changing the unit for wind speed.
- providing a childish feedback when clicking on items.
- displaying a moving sun
